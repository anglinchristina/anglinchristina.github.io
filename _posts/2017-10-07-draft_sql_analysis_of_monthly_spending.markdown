The Learn curriculum introduces us to:
* SQLite
* incorporating SQL queries into object-oriented programming with ORMs (specifically using the [SQLite3 gem](http://) which allows us to pass in Ruby variables when we execute SQL)
* ActiveRecord

Couchbase is an alternative to MongoDB and ORMs.  

N1QL is a query language that extends SQL for JSON.

Why would you want to do this instead of using ORMs?  I don't know yet.
